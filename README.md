### A message to my teachers when i submitted the project
After the deadline i made 2 commits
The first one i changed the link of the explore button on the home page and the route of the admin login page
The second one i tried to fix a problem on the pagination in the filtered result, i forgot to include the request inputs with the append method in the pagination links as i did in the search results page, on the previous commit i tried to figure it out manually but it doesn't work, in this commit i solved the problem using the same syntax that i used in the search results page.
So why i'm saying that, Because i'am not cheating or something like this. Now i'am showing this project to my Friends and Teachers and, So i want it to be perfect, So Actually i didn't Pass this criteria before the deadline, You Can Take this on consideration, Salam
